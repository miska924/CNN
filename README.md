# CNN
## Convolutional Neural Network

I am in progress for this project, so current aim is to
make difference between ZERO and ONE on a picture you draw

You can use this tool only if you have linux

First of all you need to install something to run my tool

	sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
	sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev
	sudo add-apt-repository universe
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install freeglut3-dev.

When you've done it you should make some files executable

	sudo chmod +x build*

You need to build project

	./buildAll

You can just run binary file to make sure that it works(but not so perfect)

 	./bin

Draw number(0 or 1) and close PAINT TOOL window.

You can see answer of my CNN which number it is in terminal

where you run application.

This is loop, so you can draw while you want.

You can quit my tool (CTRL + C).

### P.S.

I'm writing this project without any neural-network libs
